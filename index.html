<p>This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." Ahoy hoy? Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.</p>

<li>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</li><li>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</li><li>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</li>
